            <p>
                Hi, I’m Darrik Crawford. I started the UT Full-stack Coding Bootcamp in July of 2021. While completing the program, I simultaneously work at Indeed.com as a Senior Account Executive. <br><br>

                I received my BS in Microbiology with a minor in Biochemistry. These topics were interesting to me in college, but ultimately I decided not to purse these industries. Instead, I joined Indeed in their sales department, and have been working there for nearly four years. <br><br>

                Working at Indeed has exposed me to many different technical roles including SWEs, Developers and more. Solving problems has always excited me, so I started to lean into this coding path. After lots of research, and many conversations with industry professionals, I decided this was my path to a career I would really enjoy. <br><br>

                On a personal level, when I am not studying or completing projects you can likely find me spending quality time with my wife, Krystal, and corgi, Lani. When I need some quiet time, I enjoy nurturing my bonsai tree collection and video games. <br><br>

                I’m excited for this next journey. Please reach out with any questions or comments. I’d love to hear from you!
